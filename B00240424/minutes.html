        <li>After writing down 3 game ideas, I have decided to go for a top down shooter mixed with mechanics
            from Call of Duty Zombies and the Killing Floor franchise. I feel this idea fits into a scope
            I could complete within the short time frame but still has rich enjoyable content.</li>

        <li>The website has been fully created, I used some placeholder assets in the website creation
            to allow me to see the layout whilst the game is not yet complete. I also used Twitterâ€™s Bootstrap
            3 framework as it offers a lot of features without massive amounts of HTML, CSS or JavaScript.</li>
        <li>All of the software required for the project has been installed and activated on my home PC as
            well as my portable hard drive so I can make use of it in University.</li>
