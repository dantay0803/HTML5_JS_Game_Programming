        <h1 style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Research into Game</h1>
        <p>I originally wanted to create a First Person Shooter genre of game for the project, since however we were not
            able to use any other framework I decided to go with a top down shooter style of game. My reason for going
            with this genre is that it is similar to my original game and I have played other web based top down
            shooters that I really enjoyed. To mix up the gameplay from the general top down shooters, I decided to
            cross the gameplay with some gameplay features from both Call of Duty Zombies and Killing Floor.
        Once I knew about the genre of game I wanted to make and I had thought more about the features from Call of Duty
            Zombies and Killing Floor that I wanted to implement I created a small description of the game. After
            writing this description I asked some friends who fit into my target audience what they though. After
            getting some feedback I seen this was an idea that people liked so decided to go with it.
        I will be taking Call of Duty Zombies weapon feature where you can buy guns or ammo at any point in the round;
            I feel this is better than randomly spawning in weapons or ammo whenever a player kills a zombie as it
            gives them more choice and verity. The upgrade system I will be implementing is inspired by a class upgrade
            system featured in the Killing Floor series. The difference being the Killing Floor upgrades differ between
            the classes in the game were as my game will be using a more generalised system.</p>


        <h1 style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Story</h1>
        <p>
            You find yourself waking up on a cold, damp, hard floor, with your head pounding as if you were running
            through incoming enemy artillery. That however would be too plausible, but all you can see is a group of
            red dots getting closer and closer and the sound of painful growls getting louder by the second.<br>
            <br>Seconds later you see… soldiers… but they weren’t really soldiers anymore.<br>
            <br>One of them charges into you and you put him down with a double tap from your pistol. Still unsure what is
            really going on your only instinct now is to survive by any means necessary until you have some time
            to figure out what is happening around here.
        </p>

        <h1 style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Genre</h1>
        <p>The games genre will be a 2D top down shooter style of game crossed with a wave based survival game
            genre seen in such titles as Call of Duty Zombies and Killing Floor 1 & 2.</p>

        <h1 style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Player Goals</h1>
        <p>The object for the game is for the player to continually kill zombies in order to gain money and get the
            most points to set their high score, if at any time the player runs out of ammo they will need to buy a
            new weapon or more ammo placed around the level. The player will also need to decided what weapons they
            buy as well as how cautious they are in making every shot count in order to save as much money as
            possible to buy more and more upgrades.</p>

        <h1 style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Intended Experience</h1>
        <p>Before the first zombie of each wave even gets in the level I want the players to be on edge and
            feel extremely tense as they don’t know what is coming or even when it is coming. During an attack from
            the zombies they player should feel like they keep coming and will not stop no matter what, overall the
            game itself should feel difficult and challenging. The player will need to constantly think about what
            they are doing and what the plan to do in order to not get surrounded or have their back up against a wall.</p>

        <h1 style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Target Audience</h1>
        <p>The audience the game will be targeted towards will be both males and females from the age of 15 and
            over that have or had an interest in top down shooter and wave based survival games.</p>

        <h1 style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Intended Gameplay</h1>
        Table 3 shows the controls the player will be able to use during gameplay.
        <table border="5" style="width: 100%">
            <tr>
                <td>Player Action</td>
                <td>Controls</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Movement</td>
                <td>W, A, S & D keys</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rotate and aim player</td>
                <td>Mouse</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fire weapons</td>
                <td>Left mouse button</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Purchase weapons</td>
                <td>E key</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p style="font-size: 10px"> Table 3: Player Input</p>
        <p>During the game the player and zombies will be able to collide with each other and static
            level objects such as walls, of the player collides with a zombie however they will lose health.
            The player will also be able to kill the zombies by shooting them, each time the player does kills
            a zombie they will earn some money and points which will display their top score. The money they
            earn will be used to but new guns/ammo which will be placed around the level. Once the player
            has been killed they will then be able to purchase upgrades to their ammo count, damage and
            more health, these upgrades will also be saved  to the users account.</p>

        <h1 style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Development Method</h1>
        <p>The development method I have decided to adopt for the project is the Agile method. I have decided to
            use this method compared to other methods such as the Waterfall method, this is due to the fact the
            Agile method focuses less on the projects documentation and building the entire project at once but
            rather develop the project incrementally. Another benefit of using the Agile method over the Waterfall
            method is that the Agile method welcomes changes late into the development cycle; this can prove to
            be extremely beneficial due to the short development time available for the project. “At its core,
            agile is about being efficient, focusing on delivering quality in the work products,
            and being adaptive to change.”[1]</p>
