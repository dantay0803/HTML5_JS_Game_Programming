    <!--Game Design Research -->
    <h1>Research into Game</h1>

    <p>I originally wanted to create a First Person Shooter genre of game for the project, since however we were
        tasked with using a 2D framework I decided to go with a top down shooter genre of game. Choosing this genre
        of game meant I could incorporate a lot of elements and play styles found in First Person Shooters, my
        other reason for choosing this genre of game was that I know from experience and reading reviews of similar
        games online it can be extremely enjoyable to play. Once I had the main genre of game I wanted to create
        locked down I looked at what features I wanted to incorporate into the game, I then decided that I wanted
        to incorporate what I think are the best features from the Hotline Miami, Call of Duty Zombies and Killing
        Floor series of games.</p>

    <h2>Hotline Miami</h2>
    <b>Copies Sold:</b> 130,000 (Seven Week Period on PC) (Purchese, 2012)
    <p>Hotline Miami see’s the player play as a character named “Jacket”, “Jacket” has been receiving phone calls
        from a strange group of people who send him to various locations through an 80’s inspired Miami. At
        these locations “Jacket” has to kill various enemies including gangsters, cops and Russian mobsters
        or “Jacket” will supposedly be killed by the group that keeps calling. The game is a 2D top down shooter
        with a retro inspired art style, in terms of gameplay Hotline Miami focuses on speed by using an arcade
        style of score with the faster the player kills people one after the other the higher the score for
        each level they gain.</p>

    <h3>Features to Incorporate</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none">
        <li><b style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Retro inspired graphics:</b> My intentions for the
            art style of the game is to use a similar retro inspired style like used in Hotline Miami,
            using this art style helps give the game a distinct look and with it using less detail in
            the images it means less server space required and it will help with performance.
        </li>

        <br>
        <li><b style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Harsh and unforgiving gameplay:</b> The harsh
            gameplay of not being able to die during each level of the game or you will need to restart that
            level makes for a fun and tense gaming experience, contrary to what you would think. This is
            shown in other games such as rogue-lite genre based games where you need to restart once you die
            like the Binding of Isaac which has sales of over 1.8 million copies and FTL: Faster Than Light
            which is said to have sold over 1.6 million copies (Orland, 2014).
        </li>

        <br>
        <li><b style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Limited health:</b> Unlike the other two games
            that inspired my game idea I want to go with a similar health design like Hotline Miami, however
            unlike Hotline Miami only giving the player one life to beat an entire level I think this would
            make the game too hard and boring. So in order to counter this I will give the player 100 hit
            points every time they play the level, by doing this it should keep the game challenging but not
            too challenging like Hotline Miami and should not let the player get too bored by having
            regenerating health like in the other games.
        </li>

        <br>
        <li><b style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Gore:</b> One part of Hotline Miami that seen
            the game gather a lot of attention both good and bad was the amount of gore within the game,
            due to my game also being a violent type of game I want to incorporate some gore with blood
            splatter when a zombie is shot or a player is damaged. This type of detail adds to the overall
            experience of games which a lot of gamers enjoy.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Call of Duty: World at War Zombies</h2>
    <b>Copies Sold:</b> Over 11 million (McWhertor, 2009)
    <p>The zombie’s mode in Call of Duty: World at War see’s the player wake up as an unknown soldier inside of
        a ruined building. After a short time of waking up the player hears a strange noise off in the distance and
        sees a strange figure running towards them. After a short time undead soldiers in Nazi uniforms brake into
        the building and the soldier has to defend himself. To help there are strange markings on the wall where the
        player can magically get weapons from, similarity there is a box where the player can get a randomly
        selected gun to help kill the undead soldiers. The player must kill of the zombies in order to survive for
        as long as possible.</p>

    <h3>Features to Incorporate</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none">
        <li><b style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Endless waves of enemies to survive:</b> In my game I am going to
            use the same endless game mode used in Call of Duty Zombies where enemies will continue to spawn until the
            player is dead. This method means that the game gets increasingly harder over time unlike Killing Floor
            where
            the game ends at around 10 rounds, which means players can never push themselves. By having the ability to
            go
            for a higher number of rounds survived means the user will be able to make use of their upgrades and be able
            to
            keep challenging themselves, which can add to the appeal and longevity of the game.
        </li>

        <li><b style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Ability to buy weapons and ammo at any point in the game:</b> I will
            be taking Call of Duty Zombies weapon feature where you can buy guns or ammo at any point in the round; I
            feel
            this is better than randomly spawning in weapons or ammo whenever a player kills a zombie as it gives them
            more
            choice and verity.
        </li>

        <li><b style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Smaller enclosed level:</b> Similar to Call of Duty I plan on using
            smaller enclosed levels in my game, having the levels smaller means the player will have to think tactically
            about where to move so they do not get surrounded by too many enemies. Making this design choice also adds
            to
            the challenge of the game.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Killing Floor</h2>
    <b>Copies Sold:</b> Over 1 million (Watts, 2012)
    <p>Killing Floor is an FPS set in London, England and sees the player take controls of their choice of character
        from a selection of soldiers and special police officers. The aim of the game is to survive through a set number
        of
        waves based on the games difficulty by killing an endless army military mutations that have escaped enclosure
        from
        a science company known as Biotech’s Headquarters.</p>

    <h3>Features to Incorporate</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none">
        <li><b style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Upgrade system:</b> To add more depth to my game I want to include
            an
            upgrade system to my game similar to Killing Floors. The difference however is that in Killing Floor you can
            play as different classes and the upgrades you can unlock are pre-set, I plan on including a selection of
            upgrades with various stages to each and the user can choose which one they upgrade at the end of each run.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Features to Incorporate from both Call of Duty Zombies and Killing Floor</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none">
        <li><b style="color: rgba(197, 179, 88, 1)">Verity of weapons available:</b> A feature included in Call of Duty
            Zombies and Killing Floor is the inclusions of a verity of guns and gun types, including this kind of verity
            is
            a must in a game that requires users to restively play in order to get better and better as well as make use
            of
            all its components. Due to this I aim to include a verity of guns and gun types into my own game.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Similar Games</h2>

    <p>To also help in my design choices for my game I also looked at similar games available to purchase through the
        PC video game store Steam.</p>

    <h3>Zombie Zoeds</h3>

    <p>Zombie Zoeds is also a 2D top down shooter it has similar features to the game I aim to create such as verity of
        weapons and limited health. Zombie Zoeds however has gotten a lot of bad reviews on steam with users complaining
        about bad controls, bad looking graphics and you can only shoot in the direction you are moving. These issues
        will
        be taken on board during my development to ensure I create a better gaming experience.</p>

    <h3>Xenocide</h3>

    <p>Xenocide is another top down shooter with a lot of similarities to the game I want to create with the differences
        being in Xenocide you can collect power ups and it appears there is more than one enemy type. In terms of user
        feedback on the games Steam page it has received Mostly Positive reviews, the positive reviews highlighted that
        having unlimited ammo was a nice touch as well as no need to reload, it had a good verity of weapons and
        upgrades as
        well as the increasing difficulty kept the game fun. Whereas the negative reviews highlighted the game felt
        short
        for the price, it didn’t have a lot of weapons in some people’s opinion and there was not a lot of enemy
        types.</p>


    <!--Game Story-->
    <h1>Story</h1>

    <p>You find yourself waking up on a cold, damp, hard floor, with your head pounding as if you were running
        through incoming enemy artillery. That however would be too plausible, but all you can see is a group of
        red dots getting closer and closer and the sound of painful growls getting louder by the second.<br>
        <br>Seconds later you see… soldiers… but they weren’t really soldiers anymore.<br>
        <br>One of them charges into you and you put him down with a double tap from your pistol. Still unsure
        what is really going on your only instinct now is to survive by any means necessary until you have some
        time to figure out what is happening around here.</p>

    <!--Game Genre-->
    <h1>Genre</h1>

    <p>The games genre will be a 2D top down shooter style of game crossed with a wave based survival game
        genre seen in such titles as Call of Duty Zombies and Killing Floor 1 & 2.</p>

    <!--Player Goals-->
    <h1>Player Goals</h1>

    <p>The object for the game is for the player to continually kill zombies in order to gain money and get the
        most points to set their high score, if at any time the player runs out of ammo they will need to buy a
        new weapon or more ammo placed around the level. The player will also need to decided what weapons they
        buy as well as how cautious they are in making every shot count in order to save as much money as
        possible to buy more and more upgrades.</p>

    <!--Intended Experience-->
    <h1>Intended Experience</h1>

    <p>Before the first zombie of each wave even gets in the level I want the players to be on edge and
        feel extremely tense as they don’t know what is coming or even when it is coming. During an attack from
        the zombies they player should feel like they keep coming and will not stop no matter what, overall the
        game itself should feel difficult and challenging. The player will need to constantly think about what
        they are doing and what the plan to do in order to not get surrounded or have their back up against a
        wall.</p>

    <!--Target Audience-->
    <h1>Target Audience</h1>

    <p>The audience the game will be targeted towards will be both males and females from the age of 15 and
        over that have or had an interest in top down shooter and wave based survival games.</p>

    <!--Scope of the Project-->
    <h1>Project Scope</h1>

    <h2>Levels</h2>

    <p>The basic version of the game will include one playable level filled with various debris and objects
        to provide more detail and life to the level. The level will also contain various weapons to purchase
        and entry points for the zombies to attack the player from. If there is any development time available
        after all the basic features of the game have been implemented more levels and a level select screen
        may be added.</p>

    <h2>Player Character</h2>

    <p>The character controlled by the player will come designed in a solider uniform to fit the back story
        of the game, however the player will be able to purchase different weapons which will affect the
        way the character looks.</p>

    <h2>Enemies</h2>

    <p>The game will feature one type of enemy which is a zombie, however through the game the zombies
        will gain slightly more health and speed ever round that the user survives. The main use of
        the zombies is to spawn in large number of zombies and apply pressure through numbers of
        enemies rather than various types. To add a slight verity and to throw off the play a zombie
        will have a randomly generated chance to move faster than the other zombies.</p>

    <!--Intended Gameplay-->
    <h1>Intended Gameplay</h1>
    Table 3 shows the controls the player will be able to use during gameplay.
    <table border="5" style="width: 100%">
        <tr>
            <td>Player Action</td>

        </tr>
    </table>
    <p style="font-size: 10px"> Table 3: Player Input</p>

    <p>During the game the player and zombies will be able to collide with each other and static
        level objects such as walls, of the player collides with a zombie however they will lose health.
        The player will also be able to kill the zombies by shooting them, each time the player does kills
        a zombie they will earn some money and points which will display their top score. The money they
        earn will be used to but new guns/ammo which will be placed around the level. Once the player
        has been killed they will then be able to purchase upgrades to their ammo count, damage and
        more health, these upgrades will also be saved to the users account.</p>

    <!--Intended Goal-->
    <h1>Intended Goal</h1>

    <p>My intended goal for the game is to create a fun, enjoyable and challenging experience by combining
        what I personally feel are the best features from both the Call of Duty Zombies and Killing Floor
        franchise to create the best survival wave based shooter experience. By also mixing these features
        into a game with top down perspective and by using 2D graphics it means the game will be able to
        perform better across a verity of systems and mean the game can reach potentially a wider audience.</p>

    <!--Technical Info-->
    <h1>Technical Information</h1>
    <!--Game Mechanics-->
    <h2>Mechanics</h2>

    <p>See appendix 1 for flowcharts for the games main mechanics.</p>

    <!--Software to be Used-->
    <h2>Software</h2>

    <h3>IDE</h3>

    <p>The development environment I will be using to create both the website to host the game and to create
        the game itself will be WebStorm from JetBrains.</p>
    <h4>Reasoning and Features</h4>

    <p>The reasons for using WebStorm as my IDE is the amount of different features and benefits it brings
        compared to using a text editor like Notepad++ or Sublime Text, these features include:</p>
    <ul class="minutes">
        <li>Spellchecker.</li>
        <li>Certain empty fills come with basic required code or text, such as HTML pages contain basic
            required tags.
        </li>
        <li>Code and text is automatically updated if you rename a file.</li>
        <li>Contains auto complete feature for keywords and repeatedly used keywords.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These features alone make WebStorm an effective tool to use for any development as it can save
        a good bit of time.</p>

    <h3>Game Framework</h3>

    <p>The framework we have been tasked to use in the creation of the game is Phaser. Phaser is a fast and free
        2D framework that uses WebGL for powering browser run games and includes a canvas fall back for browsers
        with no WebGL support.</p>

    <h3>Scripting Language</h3>

    <p>To code the game I will be using vanilla JavaScript as I am more comfortable with it, I have opted not to
        use JQuery even though it can help reduce the amount of code you write just because I do not have a lot
        of experience with it and I do not want to spent too much time learning that instead of Phaser.
        TypeScript is another option that could be used when coding in Phaser but similar to JQuery I have
        no experience using TypeScript.</p>

    <h3>Tiled</h3>

    <p>To create and export the levels for the game I will be using the Tiled Software. The software allows
        you to create the made using different images and then allows you to export the map in various
        formats, one format that is helpful for web games is the JSON exporter as it compiles the image
        locations and properties into a JSON file you can use to easily create your level.</p>

    <h3>TexturePacker</h3>

    <p>I will be using a program known as TexturePacker in order to add all of my images into an atlas
        and export it as a .png and JSON file with all the images properties and the name of the single
        image file. This allows me to load the atlas in Phaser and reference each image by using the key
        name defined in the JSON file. The other benefit of this software is that it can drastically reduce
        the amount of memory required for the images which is important with web based games as this can
        help improve performance.</p>

    <h3>Piskel</h3>

    <p>Piskel is an online pixel art tool to create and export images, I will be using this to create
        the graphical assets for my game as it is an easy to use tool.</p>
    <!--Game AI-->
    <h2>AI</h2>

    <h3>Enemy Movement and Path Finding</h3>

    <p>The enemies will be able to navigate through the level avoiding various objects and walls as well as
        each other in order to reach the players position.</p>

    <h3>Enemy Attacking Player</h3>

    <p>Once the player is within a certain range to the enemies the enemies will then be able to attack
        the player and reduce the player’s health. Whilst the enemy is attacking the player the enemy
        will play an attack animation to show that they are able to hurt the player.</p>

    <!--Physics System-->
    <h2>Physics</h2>

    <p>The game will use some of the basic laws of physics such as projectiles being limited in their speed
        and range, characters not being able to move through solid objects. However in terms of movement the
        player will not experience acceleration or deceleration due to the nature of top down shooters.</p>

    <!--Game Audio-->
    <h1>Audio</h1>

    <h2>Music</h2>

    <p>The music used within the game will add suspense during moments with no enemies in the level to keep
        the player guessing when they will appear. During combat music with a faster beat will be played to
        help heighten the action and excitement during encounters with the enemy. To help accompany the retro
        look and feel of the pixel art I hope to use a retro style of video game music in the form of 8-bit
        music or chiptunes, seen in older games such as early Super Mario Bros and the Castlevania series.</p>

    <h2>Sound Effects</h2>

    <p>Sound effects will be used to express all of the actions in the game. These sound effect s will be used
        numerous times and will be used for various animations, collision events and different gun attacks.
        Some of the sound effects to be included in the game have been listed below:</p>
    <ul class="minutes">
        <li>Button clicks</li>
        <li>Enemy attacks</li>
        <li>Player damage</li>
        <li>Different gun shots</li>
        <li>Player death</li>
        <li>Zombie death</li>
        <li>Purchase sound</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Development Approach-->
    <h1>Development Method</h1>

    <p>The development method I have decided to adopt for the project is the Agile method. I have decided to
        use this method compared to other methods such as the Waterfall method, this is due to the fact the
        Agile method focuses less on the projects documentation and building the entire project at once but
        rather develop the project incrementally. Another benefit of using the Agile method over the Waterfall
        method is that the Agile method welcomes changes late into the development cycle; this can prove to
        be extremely beneficial due to the short development time available for the project. “At its core,
        agile is about being efficient, focusing on delivering quality in the work products,
        and being adaptive to change.”[1]</p>

    <!--Gantt Chart-->
    <h1>Project Development Time Frame</h1>

    <p>A Gantt Chart has been completed to designate and track the time to each of the tasks in the game to
        ensure the project meets its development deadline.</p>

    <!--Rough Design of Game Objects-->
    <h1>Concept Art</h1>

    <p>Below are sketches to show the intended design and look of the game menu, level, characters and weapons.
        The final design of all the game components is subject to change once development and testing begins,
        in order to create a better play experience for the users.</p>

    <h2>Menus</h2>

    <p>The design for the menus are below, the content on the menus will be the same at the finished
        stage however the colour scheme and layout will be different and fit the overall aesthetic and
        colour pallet of the game.</p>
    <img src="Assets/Site/Documentation/MainMenu.png" alt="Main Menu Concept" style="width: 40%; height: 40%;">
    <img src="Assets/Site/Documentation/controls.png" alt="Controls Concept" style="width: 40%; height: 40%;">

    <h2>Level</h2>

    <p>Below is a concept for the playable level in the game, the white squares inside of the
        level indicate the position of the guns that the user will be able to purchase during gameplay.</p>
    <img src="Assets/Site/Documentation/Map.png" alt="Level Concept" style="width: 75%; height: 75%;">

    <h2>Player Character</h2>

    <p>This is the concept for the character that the play will be controlling, the look of
        the player will change as they use different weapons.</p>
    <img src="Assets/Site/Documentation/player.png" alt="Player Concept" style="width: 15%; height: 15%">

    <h2>Zombie</h2>

    <p>This is the design concept for the zombie enemies in the game which the player will
        be required to kill, the final design may change to show an undead and rotted body design.</p>
